# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries to extract insights about cases, deaths, population impact, and more. The dataset used in the analysis comes from a database named `portfolioproject..CovidDeaths`. The queries cover various aspects of the data, such as calculating death percentages and identifying trends.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to explore and analyze the global impact of COVID-19 by querying and transforming data stored in a SQL database. The queries are designed to provide insights such as:
- COVID-19 case trends over time
- Death rates relative to total cases
- Countries with the highest infection rates

## Project Features
- Querying COVID-19 data using SQL
- Aggregating and sorting data by location and date
- Calculating key metrics like percentage of deaths and population impact
- Identifying outliers and high-risk countries

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Core language for querying and analyzing data
- **Database**: Assumed to be a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibrahim-02/covid19-Data-Analysis-using -SQL.git
   ```
2. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
3. Run the provided SQL scripts to execute the queries.

## Usage
1. Load the SQL file into your preferred SQL editor or database management tool.
2. Execute each query to analyze the data.
3. Modify the queries as needed to suit specific analysis goals.

## Queries Overview
1. **Basic Data Retrieval**: Fetch all records from the `CovidDeaths` table.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Retrieve data by location and date, ordered for chronological insights.
3. **Death Percentage Calculation**: Calculate the percentage of deaths relative to total cases for each location.
4. **Highest Cases and Impact**: Identify countries with the highest number of cases and the percentage of the population infected.
